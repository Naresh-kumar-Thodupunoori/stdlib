# cunone-by

> Cumulatively test whether every element in a provided array passes a test implemented by a predicate function.

## Usage

```javascript
var cunoneBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/cunone-by' );

cunoneBy( x, predicate );

var bernoulli = require( '@stdlib/random/array/bernoulli' );
var cunoneBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/cunone-by' );

// Create an array of random values:
var x = bernoulli( 10, 0.6 );
console.log( x );

// Define a predicate function:
function predicate( v ) {
    return v === 1;
}

// Cumulatively determine whether values pass the predicate:
var out = cunoneBy( x, predicate );
console.log( out );

In this example, out will contain an array of boolean values indicating whether each element in x equals 1.

This module is part of the stdlib ecosystem, providing reliable and tested implementations for standard library functions in JavaScript.
